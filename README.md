# Anki-Addons
This repository is used to store all kinds of anki addons that I created

# Looking for a maintainer!
I no longer have enough time to maintain this repository any more. If anyone is interested in maintaining this repository(especially ImageResizer, which a lot of users are using), you can contact me and continue maintaining this repository(or only ImageResizer, the other three addons are barely used) in my stead.

## [ImageResizer](http://searene.me/2016/02/14/ImageResizer-an-anki-addon-to-resize-images/)

Resize / Scale the pasted Images in Anki.

## [PurgeAttributes](http://searene.me/2016/02/14/PurgeAttributes-an-Anki-addon-to-purge-unnecessary-attributes/)

PurgeAttributes in Anki. For example, you can remove the background, the default font settings, line-height etc. in Anki.

## [GoldenDictMedia](http://searene.me/2016/02/14/GoldenDictMedia/)

Automatically import the images and audios pasted from Goldendict.

## [WriteToDisk](http://searene.me/2016/04/13/WriteToDisk/)

Save data every time a card is added or reviewed, avoid losing data when anki or system crashes.

## PurgeBrE

This is a simple addon to remove the British pronunciation in the Longman DOCE 5th dictionary.

Put [PurgeBrE](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/searene/Anki-Addons/master/PurgeBrE/PurgeBrE.py) file in the Anki's addon directory(You can find it in Anki's menu --> Tools --> Add-ons --> Open Add-ons Folder).

In fact, this addon is only meant to remove the British pronunciation in Longman DOCE dictionary, the functionality is so specific and limited I don't think others would need it. So I didn't write any documentation here at first. The reason why I put the file here is just to help others who are also writing an anki addon with a better idea on how it works.

# How to use it

Put the respective `.py` file in your Anki addon folder and restart it. Some of these addons are uploaded to [ankiweb](http://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/), you can install them from there directly.
