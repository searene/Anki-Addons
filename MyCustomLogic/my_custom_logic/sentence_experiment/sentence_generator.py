            You need to obey the following rules:
            1. Just generate the sentence, don't add extra explanations. 
            2. Wrap the word in the generate sentence with <b><u> HTML tags, e.g. <b><u>{word}</u></b>
            
            Again, don't add extra explanations! Just output the sentence! Somethings like the following contents are not allowd to be included in the response: I'm glad to help! Here's the generated sentence.
